1.  1 + 5 + 9 + ... + (4n-3) = n(2n-1)
    1 + 5 + 9 + ... + (4k-3) = k(2k-1)
    1 + 5 + 9 + ... + (4(k+1)-3) = k+1(2(k+1)-1)
    k(2k-1) + (4(k+1)-3) = k+1(2(k+1)-1)
    2k^2-k+4k+1 =    k+1(2k+2-1)
                     2k^2 + k + 2k + 1
    2k^2 +3k +1 = 2k^2 +3k +1 they are =
    
    base: 4-3 = 2-1
           1=1 they are =

2. n, n^3 + 2n is divisible by 3
