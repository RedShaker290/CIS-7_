# 61 Percival is a truth teller becuase the truth tellers can only tell truth. If Percial was the liar they would be telling the truth
then not making them the liar . Llewellynn is the liar becuase Percial claimed they were and if he isnt that means that Percival would be
be the liar but then he would be telling the truth.
# 62 This is an implication. Merlin is A and Meredith is B. So A->B. So if A B  A->B
                                                                           T T   T

It matters more what Meredith is becuase even if Merlin is a liar but Meredith ia a truthteller then she wouldnt be a liar.                                                                           
# 63 A is Rothwold and Grymlin is B: A or B
                                     A B  A or B

Rothwold is the truthteller becuase if he is right then he is not a liar and if is he the liar then and is wrong it makes him a truth 
teller.                                     
# 64 If Gwendolin is telling the truth then Gwendolin is not a liar but if he is then Nerrilian is also a liar
